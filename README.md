# Statistics and R: MechaCars
In this repo you will find files on a statistical study to help Jeremy design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest for the MechaCar.

I have also designed my own statistical study to compare MechaCar with other vehicles to determine how it will stay on top of its competition.
